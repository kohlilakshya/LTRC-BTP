asho018	ashok	Ashok Singh Sairam	Security and Privacy	Privacy in multi-agent systems	"In multi-agent systems, agents (sensors)  make a local observation and communicate the data to a central fusion centre which collates the information. The aim is to protect the privacy of the agent using compression-based privacy techniques."	1

The aim is to minimize the energy consumption in such systems by optimizing the UAV trajectory, etc."	1	
pala045	palash.ghosh	Palash Ghosh	Statistics and Game Theory	Developing a Statistical Association Measure for Coordination Games	"Summary: This project will develop a statistical association measure for a two-person coordination game. The measure will be validated, and various statistical properties will be explored based on simulated/collected data. 

Requirements: Understanding of probability, statistics, and Monte Carlo methods. Efficient programming skills in R and/or Python. Motivation to learn Statistical Game Theory. 

Outcomes: A journal article. An efficient Shiny app to conduct two-person coordination games that gives a statistical analysis of the game in real-time. "	2	
pala022	palash.ghosh	Palash Ghosh	Statistics and Machine Learning	Synthetic Data Generation	"SUMMARY: Health data contains much personal, demographic, economic, biological, and medical information. Therefore, sharing data with other stakeholders invites many potential risks. Even though we heard that tons of health data are collected daily in the era of Big-Data, you will hardly find a high-quality individual-level health dataset that can be used for research. The main reason is that companies or institutions fear sharing individual-level health data because of privacy concerns. In this project, we will develop methodologies/algorithms that will generate synthetic data that preserve the statistical properties of the real data but are free from any data privacy issues. 


REQUIREMENTS: Efficient programming skills in R and/or Python. Motivation to learn and understand the real issues in health data. You should only take the project if you want to put hard work into the project. 


OUTCOMES: A journal article. A software (code) based in R/Python that will generate privacy-preserved synthetic health data. "	2
